# BBCF-Improvement-Mod AI edition
This version of the BBCF Improvement mod adds an experimental AI that can learn from players and be used for a variety of training practices.
For a quick overview look at the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVmEPF0cRQI 

Join the [BB Improvement Mod Discord Server](https://discord.gg/j2mCX9s) to discuss about the development and the game itself!

## What you can do with the AI system:
- Have it learn from you and your opponents while you play online, to create AI copies of your opponents.
- You can play against these AI opponents in training mode to practice against them. This allows you to practice matchups player and character matchups at your leisure.
- You can record your own actions in training mode to create AI bots that an be used for specific training scenarios, allowing for specialized practice.
- You can share your AI data in a global server, allowing you to easily access specialized training bots (assuming people in the community create and share these bots)
